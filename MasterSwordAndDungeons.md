# Master Sword and Dungeons

The goal is to complete the four Divine Beasts and get the Master Sword, defeating Ganon in the end.

There are two routes you may use to quickly complete this objective. At the moment, the route provided in this document is faster than the Flying Machine one by a couple of minutes.
- **[The Original Route](https://github.com/speedfuns/botw/blob/master/MasterSwordAndDungeons.md)** is the original route featured in this document. It's based on the old route of AMQ and does not use flying machine. DLC is optional for this route.
- **[The Flying Machine Route](https://github.com/speedfuns/botw/blob/master/MasterSwordAndDungeons_FlyingMachine.md)** reaches Korok Forest early, getting extra Speed Potions on the way. It also uses a different route for Zora's Domain, using flying machine. The DLC Ruby is **neccesary** for this route.

**Neither route uses Amiibo, Master Mode, Trial of the Sword DLC, or Champions' Ballad DLC.**
